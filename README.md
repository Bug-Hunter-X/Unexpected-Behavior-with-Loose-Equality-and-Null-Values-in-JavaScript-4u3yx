This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving loose equality and null values.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with explicit null handling.  Loose equality (==) can lead to unexpected results when comparing values of different types.  This example highlights the importance of using strict equality (===) or explicitly checking for null values to ensure accurate comparisons and prevent unexpected behavior.
